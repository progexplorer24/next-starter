# Spacing Scale

<SubHeading>
  In this section we will explore all spacing values available in this design
  system.

---

Spacing is used for controlling paddings, margins, widths and heights of elements. Here, we use 4pt sizing scale, which means that every spacing value is multiple of four.

For small elements we want to have high level of precision, that's why values increments are smaller at the beginning. When you reach medium and large sizes, we don't need to be as precise. That's why we want to loosen up the scale a little bit.

## List of Available Values

<TailwindTable headings={["Name", "Size"]} specObj={spacing} />

## Examples

To control font-size in tailwindcss we use one of the variations of classes: `w-{value}`, `h-{value}`, `m-{vale}`, `p-{value}`.

**Note:** Check links below to get detailed informations on how to use spacing with tailwindcss.

<SpacingExamples data={spacing} exampleChild={<SpaceBlock />} />
