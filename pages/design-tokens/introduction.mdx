This is design system documentation I built it for my students and for my personal projects. In my everyday life I spend most of my time helping people learn STEM subjects (mostly Math) and English.

I was asked all the time about programming by my students and all of them seemed really excited about the idea of learning how to code. I decided to help them in their pursuit. I knew almost nothing about programming, so we started our education journey together. This project is our attempt to deepen our understanding of building user interfaces.

**Warning:**

This system was created mostly for educational purposes. It's goal is to help me understand the thought process and important concepts regarding design systems. It's mostly based on [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Material Design](https://material.io/).

Most of it, is actually a full reimplementation of the rules and principles that these system are based on. This project tries to put those rules **into practice** and abstract general patterns presented in them. I would like my next design systems to build upon the knowledge gathered from this project and to be a frame and a living guideline for how to build beautiful UI and UX.

Anyway if this project will help you in any way, I'm really happy. Feel free to use it and learn how design systems work with me!
