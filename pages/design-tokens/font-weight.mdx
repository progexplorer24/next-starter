# Font Weight

**List of tokens for controlling the font-weight of an element.**

There are maximally nine values available ranging from 100 to 900. You shouldn't pick more than 2-3 styles, because for every new font weight added there is a performance penalty.

## Default Tailwind Values

**Note:**
The choice between styles depends on the font family you use. Not every font lets you choose between nine styles.

<TailwindTable specObj={fontWeight} />

## Examples

To control the weight of an element use `font-{weight}`.

**Note:**
If you don't see any difference between styles, it means that this font-weight is not available. If that's the case the closest font-weight will be added as a fallback.

<FontWeights data={fontWeight}>
  <Text />
</FontWeights>
