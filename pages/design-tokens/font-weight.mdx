# Font Weight

<SubHeading>
  In this section we will explore all font-weight values available in this
  design system.
</SubHeading>

---

There are maximally nine values available ranging from 100 to 900. You shouldn't pick more than 2-3 styles, because for every new font weight added there is a performance penalty.

## Default Tailwind Values

**Note:**
To find a right font for your project we recommend checking out [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website. You can find there all available font variations. The choice between styles depends on the font family you use. Not every font lets you choose between nine styles.

<TailwindTable specObj={fontWeight} />

## Examples

To control the weight of an element use `font-{weight}`.

**Note:**
If you don't see any difference between styles, it means that this font-weight is not available. If that's the case the closest font-weight will be added as a fallback.

<FontWeights exampleChild={<Text />} data={fontWeight} />
