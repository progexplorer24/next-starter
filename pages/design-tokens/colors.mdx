## Default Tailwindcss Color Palette

You can use any color palette that you want with this design system (See - [Customizing Design Tokens](/)). Choosing right colors for your project is very important but it can sometimes be tricky.

Creating nine shades for every color requires a little bit of practice and may seem like an overwhelming task. That's why we take advantage of an amazing work of tailwindcss creators an use their [color palette](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors/) as a starting point.

When you will feel more comfortable with colors checkout the links below and see a list of sites that can help you find an inspiration for customazing it.
