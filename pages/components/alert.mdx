# Alert Component

<SubHeading>In this section we will explore how to use alerts.</SubHeading>

An alert is used to display important information, usually in response to user action.

## Basic Alert

Alerts could be divided into four categories based on the message they try to tell:

- error - action didn't go as we planned
- warning - this action can have serious consequences
- information - gives additional context to the user
- success - informs that action was successful

<Showcase
  code={dedent`<Alert> This is default alert compoenent </Alert>
      <Alert>This is default alert compoenent</Alert>
      <AlertWarning>This is default alert compoenent</AlertWarning>
      <AlertInfo>This is default alert compoenent</AlertInfo>
      <AlertSuccess>This is default alert compoenent</AlertSuccess>`}
>
  <Basic />
</Showcase>

## Variants

There are also additional variants available:

### Outlined

<Showcase
  code={dedent`<Alert type="outlined">This alert is a basic building block.</Alert>
      <AlertInfo type="outlined">Here&lsquo;s some more information.</AlertInfo>
      <AlertWarning type="outlined">
        Important. Your actions have consequences.
      </AlertWarning>
      <AlertError type="outlined">Look out! Something went wrong. </AlertError>
      <AlertSuccess type="outlined">Success! You did it.</AlertSuccess>`}
>
  <Outlined />
</Showcase>

### Filled

<Showcase
  code={dedent`<Alert type="filled">This alert is a basic building block.</Alert>
      <AlertInfo type="filled">Here&lsquo;s some more information.</AlertInfo>
      <AlertWarning type="filled">
        Important. Your actions have consequences.
      </AlertWarning>
      <AlertError type="filled">Look out! Something went wrong. </AlertError>
      <AlertSuccess type="filled">Success! You did it.</AlertSuccess>`}
>
  <Filled />
</Showcase>

## Customization

You can easily create custom variants of this component:

<Showcase code={dedent(string)}>
  <Custom />
</Showcase>

## No Icon

If you don't want to add icons to your alert, you just have to pass `icon={false}` as argument:

<Showcase
  code={dedent`<Alert icon={false}>This alert is a basic building block.</Alert>
      <AlertError icon={false}>Look out! Something went wrong. </AlertError>
      <AlertInfo icon={false}>Here&lsquo;s some more information.</AlertInfo>
      <AlertWarning icon={false}>
        Important. Your actions have consequences.
      </AlertWarning>
      <AlertSuccess icon={false}>Success! You did it.</AlertSuccess>`}
>
  <NoIcons />
</Showcase>

</MainContainer>
