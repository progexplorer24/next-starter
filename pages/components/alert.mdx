# Alert Component

<SubHeading>In this section we will explore how to use alerts.</SubHeading>

An alert is used to display important information, usually in response to user action.

## Basic Alert

Alerts could be divided into four categories based on the message they try to tell:

- error - action didn't go as we planned
- warning - this action can have serious consequences
- information - gives additional context to the user
- success - informs that action was successful

<Showcase
  code={dedent`<Alert> This is default alert compoenent </Alert>
      <Alert>This is default alert compoenent</Alert>
      <AlertWarning>This is default alert compoenent</AlertWarning>
      <AlertInfo>This is default alert compoenent</AlertInfo>
      <AlertSuccess>This is default alert compoenent</AlertSuccess>`}
>
  <Basic />
</Showcase>

## Variants

There are also additional variants available:

### Outlined

<Showcase
  code={dedent`<Alert outlined>This alert is a basic building block.</Alert>
      <AlertInfo outlined>Here&lsquo;s some more information.</AlertInfo>
      <AlertWarning outlined>
        Important. Your actions have consequences
      </AlertWarning>
      <AlertError outlined>Look out! Something went wrong. </AlertError>
      <AlertSuccess outlined>Success! You did it.</AlertSuccess>`}
