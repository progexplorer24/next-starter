# Type Scale

When building web apps, especially when there is no designer in a team, our type scale can become a mess. We often make decisions about how our typography looks like based on an impulse ("Looks good to me.") or a guesswork. This can lead to a lot of inconsistencies in our design. We should aim for creating hierarchy that works together well. That's why it's a good idea to create a type scale - a set of fixed type sizes. A type scale should **fit well in design language and be responsive across device sizes.** Sticking to a scale limits your choices (which is good because there's too much of them and you won't be using all of the font-sizes, font-weights etc. anyway) and helps you avoid design errors.

## Types of scales

When we want to create a harmonious type scale we need to choose what type of ratios we want to have between our type levels.
There are plenty of choices. Here's a small list of examples:

- Major Third
- Major Second
- Perfect Fourth
- Golden Ratio
- Perfect Fifth

Let's take a **Perfect Fourth Scale (1.333)** as an example:

| P          | H6          | H5             | H4             | H3            | H2             | H1             |
| ---------- | ----------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| 16px       | 21.33px     | 28.43px        | 37.90px        | 50.52px       | 67.34px        | 89.76px        |
| Base value | 16 \* 1.333 | 21.33 \* 1.333 | 28.43 \* 1.333 | 37.9 \* 1.333 | 50.52 \* 1.333 | 67.34 \* 1.333 |

This is the math behind creating 1.333 ratio type scale.

**Major Second Scale (1.125)**:

| P    | H6   | H5      | H4      | H3      | H2      | H1      |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| 16px | 18px | 20.25px | 22.78px | 25.63px | 28.83px | 32.44px |

**Augmented Fourth (1.414)**:

| P    | H6      | H5      | H4      | H3      | H2      | H1       |
| ---- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | -------- |
| 16px | 22.62px | 31.99px | 45.23px | 63.96px | 90.44px | 127.88px |

### Scale Conclusions

As you can see even a relatively small difference between examples above (0.289) can add up and lead to very big differences at the final levels of your type scale **(32.44px vs 127.88px)**.

**Note:**
The decimals are left there on purpose. It's not possible to reach a pixel perfect results with all the available ratios. In practice you need to round these values up or down.

## Types of websites

For typographic purposes we can divide websites into three general categories:

- **Marketing Site**
- **Blog / Information Site**
- **Product Site**

For each of this type of websites we want to use different proportions. It's natural because this sites serve different purposes. So what are the differences between those three?

### Marketing sites

With marketing sites we want to acheive a high level of contrast between the type levels. You want to focus user attention on specific part of the website.

### Blog/ Info Sites

Here we should aim for medium type ratio. Usually on this type of sites we have much more content. We want to provide nice structure for it, but we don't want the page to be too long. That's why we try to reduce the amount of space and a difference in size is smaller comapred to marketing sites.

### Product Sites

Here the text should fill nicely to the element hierarchy. You want to provide a good user experiance and help users to get something done. The text is just the addition to help them find what they want. In order to do that you want to have a flexible type scale. You want to keep ratio range low.

## Make Types Responsive

### Default - Just Increace your type scale by one.

The simplest way to adjust your font size for different screens is to go one level up or down in your typography hierarchy.
You should apply changes when you notice that the font is too small or to large for your breakpoint. It's not necessary to adjust font size on every breakpoint.

Your base font size is 16px. You can multiply every breakpoint by 1.125 so you would get:

**Normal**

| P    | H6   | H5      | H4      | H3      | H2      | H1      |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| 16px | 18px | 20.25px | 22.78px | 25.63px | 28.83px | 32.44px |

**Medium**

| P    | H6      | H5      | H4      | H3      | H2      | H1      |
| ---- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| 18px | 20.25px | 22.78px | 25.63px | 28.83px | 32.44px | 36.49px |

**Large**

| P       | H6      | H5      | H4      | H3      | H2      | H1      |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| 20.25px | 22.78px | 25.63px | 28.83px | 32.44px | 36.49px | 41.05px |

### Custom - use different type scale.

You could also increace your type scale by some other ratio. You could for example have (1.125) ratio for your type scale but you would increace your scale by (1.333) on every breakpoint.

**Note:**

The situation presented here are just an example. You can allow yourself for a lot of flexibility when it comes to making your type system responsive. An important rule to take out from this is to **remember to try to adjust your font-size between elements in your hierarchy but also between different breakpoints**. The general approach for this system will be to try to go up or down one level in hierarchy when contrast between elements is too small or too large.

## Type Scale to consider

- **Minor Second (16:15)**
- **Major Second (9:8)**
- **Minor Third (6:5)**
- **Major Third (5:4)**
- **Perfect Fourth (4:3)**
- **Augmented Fourth (1.414)**
- **Perfect Fifth (1.500)**
- **Minor Sixth (1.6)**
- **Golden Ratio (1.618)**

Using higher ratios won't be useful for web development. Font sizes would end up being way too big. So try to stick with those or mix them to create consistent experiance.
