# Introduction

This is design system documentation I built for my personal projects. This system was created mostly for educational purposes. It's goal is to help me understand the thought process and important concepts regarding design systems. It's heavily inspired by [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Material Design](https://material.io/).

Most of it, is actually a full reimplementation of the rules and principles that these system are based on. This project tries to put those rules **into practice** and abstract general patterns presented in them. I would like my next design systems to build upon this project and be the frame and a living guideline for how to build such projects. Anyway if this project will help you in any way, I'm really happy. Feel free to use it and learn how design systems work with me!
