 *
 * TODO: Add custom select element that is fully customizable and accessible. Select element doesn't provide good DX experiance.
 * [Custom Select](https://andrejgajdos.com/custom-select-dropdown/)
 * [Examples](https://speckyboy.com/open-source-css-javascript-select-box-snippets/)
 *
 * The HTML `<select>` element represents a control that provides a menu of options.
 *
 * ### Customization
 *
 * `multiple` attribute is disabled because it doesn't provide good user experiance. You should consider a better alternative for selecting
 *  multiple elements.
 *
 * ## Usage Notes
 *
 * - Each `<option>` element should have a value attribute containing the data value to submit to the server when that option is selected. If no
 * value attribute is included, the value defaults to the text contained inside the element. You can include a selected attribute on an `
 * <option>` element to make it selected by default when the page first loads.
 *
 * - The `<select>` element has some unique attributes you can use to control it, such as multiple to specify whether multiple options can be
 *  selected, and size to specify how many options should be shown at once. It also accepts most of the general form input attributes such as
 *  required, disabled, autofocus, etc.
 *
 * - You can further nest `<option>` elements inside `<optgroup>` elements to create separate groups of options inside the dropdown.
 *
 * ### Styling with CSS
 *
 * The `<select>` element is notoriously difficult to style productively with CSS. You can affect certain aspects like any element â€” for example,
 * manipulating the box model, the displayed font, etc., and you can use the appearance property to remove the default system appearance.
 *
 * However, these properties don't produce a consistent result across browsers, and it is hard to do things like line different types of form
 * element up with one another in a column. The `<select>` element's internal structure is complex, and hard to control. If you want to get full
 * control, you should consider using a library with good facilities for styling form widgets, or try rolling your own dropdown menu using
 * non-semantic elements, JavaScript, and WAI-ARIA to provide semantics.
